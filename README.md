# BMI_Calculato_App
I remember being almost 210 pounds when I was 17, though later I did sweat a lot and came down to a fit 158 pounds. During this quarantine I guess I might be gaining those pounds all over again , so here is an basic app that I built to calculate the BMI

## USAGE

Android version greater than Marshmallow 6.0 



## USAGE

This app can be used to tell if you need to hit the gym , or if your BMI is just fine or if you need to level up your carb game !



## HOW TO USE

You can download the project files and run it in an emulator with a help of android studio and its emulator or any code editor that has a plugin for android emulator or a real android device , to convert it to apk you can read the documentation provided here https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android
